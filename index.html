					<h1>About The App</h1>
					<p> As a group, we decided to design an app for party planning. In the research stage, 
						we found several similar apps in the existing market. Nevertheless, none of the apps 
						we found have included all functions we intend to add into the software: guestlist, 
						public playlist, food & drink menus, location & times. So we came up with an app to 
						help people organize events better.
